# drkim | Red Team Member • Offensive Security Researcher

Hi — I’m **drkim** (nickname, not an actual PhD 😄),  
a **Red Team member** working in offensive security.

In my day-to-day work, I focus on understanding attacker behavior and evaluating real-world attack paths, from initial access to post-exploitation.

Outside of my primary role, I have a strong interest in **open source vulnerability research**, where I explore how design and trust assumptions can fail in practical systems.

I occasionally report security issues through responsible disclosure and collaborate with maintainers throughout the fix and advisory process.

> *“Understanding how systems fail is the first step to securing them.”*

## 🔥 Offensive Security Focus

- **Red Team Operations**  
  Adversary emulation, stealth intrusion, lateral movement, and realistic attack chain design based on real threat models

- **Vulnerability Research**  
  Manual source code review, attack surface discovery, logic flaw identification, and trust boundary abuse in open source software

- **Web Application Security**  
  Authentication and authorization bypasses, IDOR, SSRF, XSS, NoSQL injection, and business logic flaws

- **Mobile Application Security (Android)**  
  APK reverse engineering, Frida-based runtime analysis, API abuse, and client-side trust bypass

- **Active Directory Attacks**  
  Kerberos abuse (Kerberoasting), ACL/GPO misconfigurations, privilege escalation paths, and domain persistence techniques

- **Wireless & Network Attacks**  
  Wi-Fi security assessments, protocol misuse, and insecure network trust assumptions

- **Offensive Tooling & PoC Development**  
  Custom exploit PoCs, automation scripts, and reproducible vulnerability verification environments

## 🏆 Verified CVEs & Security Advisories

I have reported multiple vulnerabilities that were accepted, fixed, and assigned official identifiers through coordinated disclosure.

### Global CVEs (MITRE / NVD)
- **CVE-2026-XXXX** – Assigned and pending public advisory publication  
- **CVE-2026-XXXX** – Assigned and pending public advisory publication  
- **CVE-2026-XXXX** – Assigned and pending public advisory publication  

### Korean Vulnerability Entries (Korea Internet & Security Agency)
- **KVE-2025-0142** – Private disclosure  
- **KVE-2025-0250** – Critical session architecture flaw enabling privilege escalation  
- **KVE-2025-0249** – Insecure interface behavior leading to unauthorized data exposure  
- **KVE-2025-0248** – Logic-level vulnerability impacting transactional integrity  

> My focus is on vulnerabilities with **real security impact**, validated through practical exploitation scenarios rather than theoretical weaknesses.
