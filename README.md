# drkim | Red Team Member • Offensive Security Enthusiast

Hi there — I’m **drkim** (just a nickname, not an actual PhD 😄), a **Red Team member** involved in offensive security operations and adversary emulation.  
I specialize in discovering vulnerabilities through realistic attack scenarios, including **initial access**, **runtime application manipulation** ,**web/mobile app exploitation**, and **custom tooling**.

In my free time, I build web platforms and browser-based games as creative side projects using JavaScript and Node.js.
