# drkim | Red Team Member • Offensive Security Enthusiast

Hi there — I’m **drkim** (just a nickname, not an actual PhD 😄), a **Red Team member** involved in offensive security operations and adversary emulation.  
I specialize in discovering vulnerabilities through realistic attack scenarios, including **initial access**, **runtime application manipulation** ,**web/mobile app exploitation**, and **custom tooling**.

In my free time, I build web platforms and browser-based games as creative side projects using JavaScript and Node.js.

## Offensive Security Focus

- **Red Team Activities** – APT-style simulation, stealth access, attack chains    
- **Penetration Testing** – Vulnerability discovery through scenario-driven engagement  
- **Web Hacking** – NoSQL INJ, IDOR, SSRF, logic bugs, XSS  
- **Mobile App Hacking** – Android reverse engineering, Frida-based runtime analysis
- **Wireless Network Security** – Assessing Wi-Fi environments and protocol weaknesse
- **Active Directory Attacks** – Kerberoasting, ACL abuse, GPO hijacking, DCSync 
- **Tooling** – Scripting automation, payloads, and light C2 interfaces
